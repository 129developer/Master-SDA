It is a Software Development Assistent, it is mainly developed to assist sw development in my currently working company bayasys,   

With this we can create a bunch of files that are needed to develop an option in our system like Dao, Dto, Service, Service Implimentation, Controller etc in java 
And MVC and MVVM structured JS files by just giving a sql table name and joins.

i have also added options to store function definitions and component definitions using this application.  
So that if i need the same function or component again and again , open the code editor in the application right click where you want to add the function and select from the dropdown menu.
